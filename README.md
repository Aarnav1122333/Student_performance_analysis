# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This mini project focuses on analyzing student performance data to identify patterns and trends using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project uses visualizations and summary statistics to understand how different factors relate to academic outcomes.

## Objective
To analyze student performance data and extract meaningful insights using Python-based data analysis techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` → Main analysis notebook  
- `dataset.csv` → Dataset used for analysis  
- `README.md` → Project overview and instructions  

## Analysis Performed
- Data loading and inspection  
- Basic data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of score distribution and categorical comparisons  

## Visualizations Used
- Histogram for score distribution  
- Bar charts for category-wise performance comparison  
- Scatter plots where applicable  

## Key Insights
- Student scores follow a clear distribution pattern  
- Performance varies across different categories  
- Visual analysis helps reveal trends not obvious from raw data  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells in order  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates foundational data analysis skills, including data handling, visualization, and interpretation. It serves as a beginner-friendly mini project suitable for academic and early internship purposes.
